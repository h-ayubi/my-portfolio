# My Portfolio

## ðŸ”¹ Theme / Inspiration

This portfolio follows a minimal and professional theme, inspired by several modern web designers' personal websites, especially their blog sections.  
The color palette was chosen using (https://coolors.co), aiming for a clean yet visually appealing experience.

## ðŸ”¹ Design Decisions

I wanted the layout to look professional and build trust at first glance, while keeping everything clear and easy to navigate for potential clients.

Here are some key decisions:
- One-page layout with 5 clear sections: Home, About Me, Projects, Blog, Contact.
- *mooth scrolling and clean sectioning to improve the user journey.
- Chosen fonts:  
  - Anton for main heading  
  - Noto Sans Arabic for subheadings  
  - Segoe UI and other system fonts for body text  
- Used subtle hover effects and SVG animations to keep it interactive but not overwhelming.

## ðŸ”¹ Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge I faced was making the website responsive on different screen sizes.  
At first, some sections broke or overlapped, but I reviewed my layout and fixed the responsiveness with proper use of flexbox and media queries.
